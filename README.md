This repository has a lot of the project files I used to make this video

# Animations
I made the animations by a combination of Manim, Blender, and DaVinci Resolve (a code library, 3d modeling software, and video editing software respectively). Most of the Manim code I used for the video is in the `manim/` folder, sorted by chapter and timestamp. Here is a good guide for setting up Manim if you want to use it.

Some of the chapter 3 code will also require the manim_physics library, which you should be able to get by running `pip install manim_physics` after you have Manim.

A lot of the code is not well-organized or implemented in the best manner, since my focus was on finishing the video, not making good code.

# Script
The main script I used for the video is in `script.md`. 

# LaTeX
LaTeX is a language used for rendering math equations on the computer. You can see it used in Manim whenever a Tex() or MathTex() object is made. Some of the long-form LaTeX I wrote is in the `tex/` folder.
